## Concept 1: Modern Minimalist with Asymmetric Grid
**Design Movement:** Contemporary Swiss Design + Digital Minimalism
**Probability:** 0.08

### Core Principles
- Radical whitespace and breathing room
- Asymmetric grid layouts that break predictability

- Projects grid: Alternating full-width and half-width cards
- Navigation: Sticky minimal top bar with only essential links
- Footer: Sparse contact info with generous spacing

### Signature Elements
- Thin geometric dividers (1px lines) separating sections
- Animated underlines on hover for interactive elements
- Subtle parallax scrolling on project cards
- Monospace font for technical details and code snippets

### Interaction Philosophy
- Smooth fade-in animations on scroll
- Hover states that reveal additional project details
- Micro-interactions: button scale, link underline expansion
- Cursor follows subtle visual feedback

### Animation
- Page load: Staggered fade-in of text elements (200ms intervals)
- Scroll: Subtle parallax on hero image and project cards
- Hover: 300ms cubic-bezier easing for all interactive elements
- Transitions: Smooth 0.3s ease-in-out for state changes

### Typography System
- Display: Playfair Display (serif, bold) for headings
- Body: Inter (sans-serif, regular) for content
- Accent: IBM Plex Mono for code and technical details
- Hierarchy: 3.5rem (h1) → 2.25rem (h2) → 1.125rem (body)

- Bold geometric shapes as background elements
- Thick borders and chunky typography

### Interaction Philosophy
- Click reveals hidden project details
- Hover creates dramatic shadow expansion
- Scroll triggers staggered element movements
- Bold, confident interactions that match the aesthetic

### Animation
- Page load: Elements slide in with bounce easing
- Scroll: Cards rotate and scale as they enter viewport
- Hover: Shadows expand dramatically, scale increases 1.05x

### Typography System
- Display: Bebas Neue (ultra-bold, all-caps) for main headings

- Ornamental dividers between sections
- Symmetrical layouts with intentional balance

### Interaction Philosophy

- Interactions feel refined and deliberate

### Animation
- Page load: Elements fade in with subtle scale (0.95 → 1)
- Scroll: Gradient backgrounds shift as user scrolls
- Hover: Metallic gradient intensifies, borders glow
